# Gunasekaran Pasupathy — Research

This organization hosts my **independent research artifacts** in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Quantum Machine Learning**.

The goal of this work is **research-level understanding and contribution**, with an emphasis on:
- mathematical foundations
- reproducibility
- careful experimental design
- transparent documentation of results and limitations

This repository structure mirrors how research is conducted in academic and industrial research labs.

## 🧪 Research Standards

All work in this organization follows these principles:

- **Reproducibility**
  - pinned environments
  - documented datasets
  - recorded random seeds where applicable

- **Scientific discipline**
  - baseline matching before extensions
  - controlled ablations
  - negative results documented

- **Attribution**
  - original authors clearly cited
  - this work focuses on analysis, reproduction, and extension

---

## 📄 Publications & Reports

- Preprints, technical reports, and extended analyses are maintained in:
  - `writing-preprints`
  - linked from the `research-portfolio` index

When applicable, code and experimental artifacts are released alongside written work.

## 📌 Notes

- This organization is **research-oriented**, not product-oriented.
- Some repositories may remain private during early exploration phases.
- Public repositories represent **clean, reviewed, and reproducible work**.
